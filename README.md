# Gas Pipeline Safe Operation Velocity & Flowrate Calculator

# Project Overview
This application calculates the safe operational velocity and flow rate for a gas pipeline, considering factors like compressibility factor (Z), gas temperature, pressure, gravity, and pipe diameter. It provides valuable insights for ensuring safe and efficient gas pipeline operation.

# Features
Calculates both maximum velocity and safe operational velocity
Calculates volumetric flow rate in cubic meters per hour (m³/h) and normal cubic meters per hour (Nm³/h)
User-friendly interface with clear input fields and labeled results
