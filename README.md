# Clean Gas Pipeline Safe Operation Velocity & Flowrate Calculator

# Project Overview
This application calculates the safe operational velocity and flow rate for a clean gas pipeline, considering factors like compressibility factor (Z), gas temperature, pressure, gravity, and pipe diameter. It provides valuable insights for ensuring safe and efficient gas pipeline operation.

# Features
- Calculates both maximum velocity and safe operational velocity
- Calculates volumetric flow rate in normal cubic meters per hour (NmÂ³/h)
- User-friendly interface with clear input fields and labeled results
